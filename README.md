# Chris Bemister's Portfolio Website

## Overview

I am building this website as both a portfolio project to showcase what I have built, and as a platform to help me build new website functionality and applications. I am not always able to apply at my current position the advanced web development techniques that I have been learning. The website has the following features & functionality: built using Next.js to create a Reactbased server-side rendered app, uses Sanity.io to store the content in a headless CMS, hosted on Netlify static site hosting, automatic deployment through Zapier using web hooks and Github. I also converted it to a progressive web app using an npm package called next-offline.
